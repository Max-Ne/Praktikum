-differential cross section of compton scattering depending on scattering angle
-energy shift of scattered photons depending on scattering angle and rest energy of electrons
-dependance of cross section on atomic number

2x2 scattering: photon + electron at rest -> scattered photon with different energy + electron at rest
    (electron at rest means kinetic energy << energy of photon)
    also compton effect only measurable, when photon energy of the order of magnitude of rest energy of scattering particle
        => compton cross section instead of thomson scattering
